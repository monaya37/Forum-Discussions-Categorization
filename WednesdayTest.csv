5,"Of course they take a SMALL commissioned rate if you sell something that's well a grand or something.  But the listing fees are small, and if you own a ebay Store on the site it costs you 10 bucks a month for it.  But they do not take your profits.  That only occurs when you sell something that gets in the very high price ranges, like 500 to 1,000 dollars or more.  I've sold and brought items from eBay for over five years, and I've never had eBay make  profit from it.  Go to the site and check out their rules and regulations.  Good luck."

9,"History was made in New York on October 6th, 1927 when the very first spoken voice in a feature film was heard.\n\nThe voice belonged to Al Jolson and the ground breaking movie â€“ The Jazz Singer. The reaction by the theatre audience was immediate â€“ they rose to their feet, applauding ecstatically. The moment came in the middle of the film when, during a nightclub scene, Jolson suddenly spoke.\n\n\n The first words ever spoken in a movie were, â€œWait a minute, wait a minute. You ainâ€™t heard nothinâ€™ yet!â€ The words were truly prophetic in light of the massive advances taken in the realms of movie sound since that time."

12,"If you don't believe in yourself, how can anyone else believe in you.  If you don't have the support of those around you who don't believe it you, then you have to find it in yourself and realize you want something so bad that you will achieve it.  As hard as the road can be, if you don't keep trying, you are just going to prove all those other people that they were right.  Set your mind to it and try and your chances of achieving what you want will be pretty high!\n\nI'll beleive in you!"
13,"The Enola Gay is at the Smithsonian Institute.  It is the most photographed airplane ever.  Do some YAHOO! searches to discover the value of your ""hidden camera"" photos.  Be prepared to document proof that your grandfather served at the base where the photos were taken (DD214 duty assignments, pay slips, etc.).  Sworn testimonials, documentations and so forth.  You cannot determine the value of anything without doing research, then the value is determined by what someone is willing to pay and what someone is willing to accept.  Another source of internet research is AUCTION HOUSES.  Otherwise, anyone who blindly gives you an ""educated guess"" as a quick answer for 2 points needs educating himself.  Good research is your answer."

You can not search on the basis of person's name. There is no options in the advanced search also.\n\nI personally feel that this setting is right. If I am asking questions, why should I be known to people.\n\nHope it helps."
